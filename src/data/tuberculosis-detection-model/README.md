# Tuberculosis Detection Model Dataset

We have compiled the Tuberculosis and non-Tuberculosis (includes healthy individuals and sick individuals with other pulmonary diseases) images from the original TBX11K dataset and the NIH dataset.

Currently the dataset contains the files from the Kaggle TBX11K and the Kaggle Qatar datasets:

- Non-TB: 
  - 6600 healthy from TBX11K
  - 1800 sick non-TB from TB11K
  - 406 normal from Qatar (NIH)
  - 3094 normal from Qatar (RSNA)

- Tuberculosis:
  - 306 TB from Qatar (Belarus)
  - 394 TB from Qatar (NIH)
  - 800 TB from TBX11K

The rough estimate so far is 1491 TB images and 11007 non-TB images.
